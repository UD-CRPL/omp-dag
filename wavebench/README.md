# Wavebench
Wavebench is an application designed to model the performance of a wavefront sweep application. It can be compiled for serial execution or parallel execution utilizing OpenACC. Flexible command line parameters allow users to model the performance under many different conditions by varying the number of spatial dimensions explored, the size of the spatial dimensions, size of individual gridcell components, and the number of in-gridcell computations performed.
